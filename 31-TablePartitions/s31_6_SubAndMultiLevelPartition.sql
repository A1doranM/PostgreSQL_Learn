-- Sub Partitioning
-- #############################

/*

    1. A single partition can also be a partitioned table

    2. Caution:

        When we create multi-level partitions specially on ranges, it is easy to create a
        large number of subpartitions, some containing or no data.

    3. Sub partition naming conventions played a vital role here, so plan the naming.
